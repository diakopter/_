<h3>TCB Kernel Loader</h3>
<p>
Reminder: check your <a href="#"
onclick="document.getElementById('warning').style.display='inline'"</a>
assumptions about <strong>privacy</strong> and <strong>integrity</strong></a>
<span id="warning" style="display:none">: TLS was correctly used to load this page,
the URL is correct, the code below is correct, neither this device, any of its
software, nor your environment has ever been compromised, and you are not acting
under duress or undue influence. Privacy includes secrecy of your data's location
and the data itself, and secrecy of your identity when you want it (anonymity) for
any of your activities online or offline. Integrity includes reliability and
certainty that your data is coming from where you think it is and it hasn't been
modified more than you expected. This Operating System is reliably secure under
the above assumptions, but not otherwise. It is designed not to permit disclosure
or leakage of any information without your express permission and awareness, and
without recording everything securely online for repudiation if necessary, and all
communications maintain perfect forward secrecy [under the additional assumption
that nothing about your recipient is compromised].
